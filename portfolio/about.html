            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <br>
            <p>I completed my education at Nucamp Coding School, gaining expertise in JavaScript, HTML, and CSSâ€”fundamental skills for effective coding. I also hold an Associate's degree in Business from Clackamas Community College and have proudly served nearly 10 years in the Air National Guard as a Security Forces member, assisting during local state emergencies and wildlife fires.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I bring a keen attention to detail and a strong commitment to personalized customer service. My experiences have equipped me with the skills necessary to navigate eCommerce and vintage clothing reselling, making me well-versed in how to effectively list and promote products online.</p>
            <p>I am passionate about sports, especially the NBA, and I'm excited for my team, the Mavericks, to make a strong run this season. Living in Portland, Oregon, I appreciate the city's unique charm, from its diverse food scene to the beautiful seasons. In my free time, I enjoy outdoor activities with my labradoodle, Henry, and cherish moments with my wife as we prepare to start a family.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As a vintage clothing reseller for over a decade, I've honed my eCommerce skills. Born and raised in Portland, I am deeply connected to my community, loving everything from the rain to the vibrant culture and people.</p>
            <p>One of the most impactful experiences in my life was during the Oregon Gorge fires. What began as a week-long assignment turned into nearly two months of service. The challenges were tough, but seeing the relief and gratitude on people's faces as we helped them made the experience worthwhile. This solidified my commitment to giving back to my community and illustrated the core values instilled in me.</p>
            <p>I aspire to build a loving family with my wife while continuously adding to my portfolio. I look forward to enjoying my career in this amazing field and making a positive impact through my work.</p>
