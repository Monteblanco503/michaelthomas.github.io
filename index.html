        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I am a passionate front-end web developer focused on creating user-friendly, personalized websites. 
            What inspired me to pursue this career was realizing how many people I could help reach their own goals—whether it’s supporting influencers, entrepreneurs, or those with side projects. 
            I aim to offer my services to anyone who needs that extra push or step to advance their vision.
            My skill set includes developing responsive, performance-optimized websites that work seamlessly across various screen sizes. 
            Although I don’t have a unique niche yet, as a recent graduate from Nucamp Coding Bootcamp, I’m eager to explore different areas of web development and build a diverse portfolio. 
            I’m currently seeking new opportunities and collaborations to further grow my experience and contribute to meaningful projects.
